1. Finish getting all the song track IDs
2. Retrieve all the song attributes using https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features
3. Plots:
    - time series for each of the traits
    - correlation of "weeks on board" and each traits
    - correlation of "peak rank" and each traits
    - correlation of "spotify popularity" with each traits
    - correlation matrix between each pair of song traits
    - histograms of the traits by decade (e.g. "what's the average danceability of the top songs in the 1970s?")
    - https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-using-spotify-song-features-9eb7d53d105c
    - radar/spider charts (i.e. what makes a hit? https://towardsdatascience.com/what-makes-a-song-likeable-dbfdb7abe404)
        - https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/projects/what-makes-a-hit/
    - unsupervised learning:
        - cluster songs based on traits (https://tomasezequielrau.medium.com/clustering-forecasting-spotify-songs-audio-features-5b2c21f0a6b9)
        - what cluster has "staying power"? i.e. it's popularity is still high even though it's 20+ years old?
